# Face ID Access Gate App

This is our Senior project at DAUST, year 2023, which is to build a face id recognition system with a turnstile tripod.

### What this program does
Here, we used the intel realsense id sdk which provide authentications and enrollment stubs for us to focus on integration and building a simple Tkinter (python) app that will enable their use.
